* Nix flake for JDK Mission Control

This repository contains a flake which provides a derivation for [[https://github.com/openjdk/jmc][JMC]].

It currently provides a flake with a derivation packaging up the pre-built binaries from the [[https://adoptium.net][Eclipse Adoptium]] project.

** Usage

The flake provides a single default package, ~jmc~. If you have flakes installed, you should be able to add the ~jmc~ command to your path.

#+begin_src sh
  nix shell github:nix-java/jmc
  jmc
#+end_src

*** Known issues

 - The derivation currently does not work on [[https://swaywm.org/][sway]] (see [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/76168][nixpkgs#76168]]).
